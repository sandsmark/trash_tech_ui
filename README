This is a program which displays a fancy tech-looking screen,
which has been used in a movie. It's probably useless for
everyone.

If you should still want to run it,
 * You need the "Perfect Dark Zero" TTF font (google it) in
   /usr/share/fonts/TTF/Perfect Dark Zero.ttf
 * Since this program was to be used on only one notebook
   it is written for 1440x900 resolution and will break in
   any other resolution

Other than that, to run it
qmake
make
./detektor

or just
qmlviewer detektor_ui.qml
